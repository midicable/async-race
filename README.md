This is a single-page application, that implements race functionality. There are two viwes: garage and winners. 

When on a "garage" page you can start a race as well as set a car's engine to driving mode independently. Moreover, you can perform basic CRUD operations to add car, remove car, change car's name or color!

Winners page allows you to watch cars statistics (numbers of wins, best time, etc.). You can also sort the list of winners by id, numbers of wins or best time.
